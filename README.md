## User background

I am participating in TIktok techjam 2026. I took classes in CUDA before but have mostly forgotten all of it, and need to relearn probably from scratch. I'm not good at math, not good at CUDA, and don't know much about modern LLMs or even machine learning in general (know about basics like linear regression, but not advanced like transformers).

I will try and learn along the way, but you will be the one doing most of the work, while I try to follow along.

3. Implement a GPU Kernel for a Transformer Layer

3.1 Background

Transformer is a widely used neural network architecture in modern AI. It is the core structure behind many natural language processing, computer vision, speech, recommendation, and large language model systems.
The main idea of Transformer is self-attention. Self-attention allows each token in a sequence to interact with other tokens directly. Compared with recurrent models, Transformer can process tokens in parallel, which makes it suitable for GPU acceleration.
Given an input sequence represented as a matrix:
$$X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$$
where $$N
$$ is the sequence length and $$d$$ is the hidden dimension, the Transformer first projects the input into Query, Key, and Value matrices:
$$Q = XW_Q$$
$$K = XW_K$$
$$V = XW_V$$
The scaled dot-product attention is computed as:
$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) =
\text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$
where $$d_k
$$ is the dimension of each attention head. The scaling factor $$\sqrt{d_k}$$ is used to prevent the dot-product values from becoming too large, which could make the softmax distribution unstable.
However, the computation of Transformer is expensive. Important operations include matrix multiplication, attention score calculation, softmax, normalization, and feed-forward layers. These operations may be limited by GPU compute throughput, memory bandwidth, cache efficiency, kernel launch overhead, and tensor core utilization.
In this competition, participants are asked to use AI-assisted methods to optimize the runtime efficiency of a Transformer structure on a given GPU model. The optimized implementation should improve performance while keeping the output numerically correct compared with the reference implementation.
Participants may consider optimization methods such as operator fusion, memory layout optimization, reduced-precision computation, tensor core usage, softmax optimization, and custom CUDA, Triton, TensorFlow, or PyTorch implementations.
The goal of this task is to explore how AI can help developers analyze Transformer workloads, identify bottlenecks, and generate more efficient implementations for specific GPU hardware.
3.2 Problem Statement
- Given a fixed formula of transformer layer, participants need to submit one or several GPU kernels that implement the layers that can pass the given test cases.
- The test cases would be written in pytorch or tensorflow and the participants can modify the layer implementation if they need, which means they can decide which parts of the layers should be fused into 1 kernel.
- The test case would compare the differences between the implementation of participants and the original pytorch/tensorflow implementation, the diff should be small enough (relative error < 0.02, abs error < 0.002).
- The test cases would contain different shapes of input, including large/small batchsize, large/small sequence length, large/small dimensions, etc. The participants can choose different implementations for different shapes by adding shape checks in the implementation of layers. All the combinations of input shapes will be told to the participants.
- The use of AI tools is encouraged so that the participants can implement different kernels for different input shapes in limited time.
- Optimize & test your codes on your own machine. Different methods may be used to optimize the codes depending on the machine (GPU cards) you use.
- Provide a clear tech report including details on the AI skills/tools used to get bonus points.
- What participants need to do:
  - Download the benchmark scripts (choose either torch or tensorflow, one of them would be enough).
  - Implement the customized-implementation part and optimize it as fast as you can by AI or by hand.
  

    - Run the script on your own machine.
  - Provide a clear tech report illustrating what the environment is (CPU, GPU, DISK, etc), what kind of optimizations you have done, and the final test results.
